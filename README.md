# RPi CM4 - LiM Carrier Board

A minimalistic Raspberry Pi (RPi) Compute Module 4 (CM4) Carrier Board. Less is More (LiM) refers to the minimalistic design only providing 5V power via USB-C power connector and two status (power/activity) LEDs.

This is meant for CM4 boards with onboard storage and wifi as this carrier boards provides no other functionalty other than power and status LEDs.

Feel free to modify this design for your own application. This PCB is currently being prototyped.

Other iterations of the LiM board, inlcuding SD card tray and flashing capability) are in the design stages.
