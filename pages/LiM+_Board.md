# RPi CM4 - LiM+ Carrier Board

The second version of the minimalistic Raspberry Pi (RPi) Compute Module 4 (CM4) Carrier Board. Less-is-More (LiM) refers to the minimalistic design in its [original version](../pages/LiM_Board.md) only providing 5V power via USB-C power connector and two status (power/activity) LEDs. The LiM+ Carrier Board is the 'larger' sibling to the LiM Board by adding flashing capability of the Compute Module 4. Flashing can be done similarly to the [flashing process](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md) with the [CM4 IO board](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4-io-board/). 

This board is also meant for CM4 boards with onboard storage and wifi as this carrier board provides no other functionalty other than power, status LEDs and above mentioned flashing capability.

It took about two months from idea to the prototype. The PCB design files are can be found [here](https://github.com/l00nix/rpi-cm4-LiM-board/tree/main/hardware/rpi-cm4-LiM%2B-board) 

Here are some pictures and 3D renders of the LiM Carrier Board:
