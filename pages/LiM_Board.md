# RPi CM4 - LiM Carrier Board

The first version of the minimalistic Raspberry Pi (RPi) Compute Module 4 (CM4) Carrier Board. Less-is-More (LiM) refers to the minimalistic design only providing 5V power via USB-C power connector and two status (power/activity) LEDs.

This is meant for CM4 boards with onboard storage and wifi as this carrier board provides no other functionalty other than power and status LEDs.

It took about two months from idea to the prototype. The PCB design files are can be found [here](../hardware/rpi-cm4-LiM-board/) 

Here are some pictures and 3D renders of the LiM Carrier Board:
